## how to contribute
1. clone the repo using the github desktop app — make sure the folder goes somewhere you have easy access to
2. hit the "fetch origin" button in the github app to fetch & pull any changes
3. open the github folder as an obsidian vault with the obsidian desktop app
4. make any changes you want to *in the /content folder*
	1. use the "default" file template (type `/templates` to use the obsidian command)
	2. add yourself as an author to any posts you create
	3. make sure each post you make has a tag — it might not be published without one
	4. if you want a post to remain hidden, check the "draft" property
5. once you've made your changes, go back to the github app & hit the blue "commit" button
6. push your changes to github! all done!

## callouts

> this is what a callout looks like! these are good for adding little side-notes & additional comments. make sure you use the `[!NAME] NAME` syntax, with your name in those two spots (the callout type, and the callout title) so the callout is correctly attributed to you on the site.
