> The most difficult part of writing a travel journal is coming up with the beginning.[^1]

Welcome to our little Genshin Impact travel journal — this is where we ([Jillian](https://ooolong.netlify.app/) & Laura) have started keeping track of all our haphazard notes and thoughts about Genshin lore. If none of it makes any sense at all, that's fine. It's not a Wiki, it's not meant to be perfect or comprehensive, and it's very much a constant work in progress.
## Why?

Genshin Impact lore is really cool & interesting — there are so many themes, so many motifs, so many references. It's hard to keep it all straight without feeling a little nuts. We've been sending incomprehensible Discord messages to each other about it all for a long time, and we wanted to start keeping better track of it all in a way that's both easy to edit & easy to share.
## Where to start

If you're on desktop, you might see a handy little "Explorer" in the left sidebar, where you can browse posts by category. You can also just start searching for anything you're interested in, and some pages will probably come up. Or you can just check out our most recent posts:
