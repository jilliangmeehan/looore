> The most difficult part of writing a travel journal is coming up with the beginning.[^1]

Welcome to our little Genshin Impact travel journal — this is where we ([Jillian](https://ooolong.netlify.app/) & Laura) have started keeping track of all our haphazard notes and thoughts about Genshin lore. If none of it makes any sense at all, that's fine. It's not a Wiki, it's not meant to be perfect or comprehensive, and it's very much a constant work in progress.

## Why?
Genshin Impact lore is really cool & interesting — there are so many themes, so many motifs, so many references. It's hard to keep it all straight without feeling a little nuts. We've been sending incomprehensible Discord messages to each other about it all for a long time, and we wanted to start keeping better track of it all in a way that's both easy to edit & easy to share.
