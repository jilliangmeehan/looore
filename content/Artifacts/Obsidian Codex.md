## Reckoning of the Xenogenic
> A flower meticulously carved from black crystal. It emits a mysterious light at night.

> [!jillian]
> "Xenogenic" describes "tissues or cells belonging to individuals of different species."

In the days when the dispossessed divine envoys fell into realms devoid of light, and when the rule newly returned destroyed the blasphemous citadel, many stories transpired that were never recorded or lauded in any human history.

> [!jillian]
> Okay let's start there. "Dispossessed" divine envoys fell into the Night Kingdom, whatever that means. Reminds me of [[The Tale of Qoyllor and Ukuku|Qoyllor]] falling from her star.
> 
> I wonder if "the rule newly returned" refers to Nibelung. Or the Second Who Came. Or maybe they're one and the same?

In the kingdom of vishaps lucky enough to survive when heaven and earth collapsed, and sundered by a vast sea of red soil, where their kin could only scrape by, impoverished in the Outer Sea, they enjoyed freedom by the grace of the one who ruled over flames.

> [!jillian] 
> Trying to place this on the timeline — it sounds like it's happening around the time of the Second Who Came. We probably have no archons yet and apparently all the divine envoys just fell into the Night Kingdom. This should have all happened before Morax was even born.
> 
> "The one who ruled over flames" must be the Pyro Sovereign, or [[Xiuhcoatl]] (or maybe they're the same).
> 
> As for the "vast sea of red soil," maybe this is the "red and black" place mentioned in [[Records of Hanan Pacha]].

And yet ==the wisdom of fire had already been seized by the tide of feculent darkness==, only its gray corpse shambled on. To maintain dragonkind's remnant might, their blind, foolish heirs took violence for the rule of law. In this land of cinder soon to vanish, upon which the sun had set, only one "human" cast their gaze toward the begloomed future.

> [!jillian] 
> I have lots of questions. At first, I thought "the wisdom of fire" *was* the Sacred Flame, but in [[Records of Hanan Pacha]], it only represents the power of the dragons. The wisdom given to humanity comes from the [[Sage of Stolen Flame]] himself.
> 
> Still unclear to me what he actually is — here, he's called a "human." In [[Records of Hanan Pacha]], he's also called a human. In other places, he's called a dragon. No idea.
> 
> Maybe he was in disguise? Maybe he was part-human? Maybe he was fully human but raised with dragons? Who knows.

"I see light fall upon the rootless earth, the dragons prostrating before their ruler's deathbed.
"I see great wisdom, great art, great civilization — and all shall perish.
"But endless cycles are the law of the world, and history will not cease on account of our sorrows.
"But tragic are my kin, for they see not how their folly served to aid history's iron rule.
"Servants today shall be rulers tomorrow. Past slaves shall be future masters.
"Our race is mired in spiraling contradiction inexorable. Only in [[Fertilizer Impact|sowing seeds]] shall we find salvation.
"Perhaps, out there in the abundant primordial wilderness, there is a land that has yet to know the touch of filth and decay."

Thus, passing through searing flame and raging wind, it took as-yet unextinguished primordial kindling from the ancient palace beneath the magma. Bearing the hopes of another race, the wisest of dragons bid farewell to the splendorous city ineffable.

> [!jillian]
> See, here he's called "the wisest of dragons." 
> 
> Anyway, the dragons are lamenting the death of "their ruler." At first I thought this was Nibelung, and then I thought maybe it was [[Xiuhcoatl]]. But knowing how the story goes in [[Records of Hanan Pacha]], it might just be the self-proclaimed Volcano Lord.
> 
> So, the Sage of Stolen Flame takes a seed from the Sacred Flame to give to humanity, because he sees that this is the best path forward for all of them. (When he says "our race," I wonder which race exactly he's talking about.)
> 
> This "iron rule" is also mentioned in [[Unfinished Reverie]]. 
> 
> Also — the ineffable city? The same ineffable Cinder City of the [[Sacred Lord]]? 

## Root of the Spirit-Marrow
>A feathered accessory made in imitation of an ancient dragon's wing. Perhaps it was once a memento of some forgotten history.

In the age when wildfire consumed the roots of the world, and when the barbarian tribes sliced through the thorns to open the mountains and woods, many stories transpired that were never recorded or lauded in any human history.

The wisest among dragons traversed the burning plains, carrying the seed split from the primal flame, stepping into a rugged, untamed land. Yet as it walked through hot springs and valleys that dragonkind had yet to touch, seeing things grown from soil or created, none met its expectations.

Until one day, when the fog dispersed in a deep valley, it discovered the creator's most beloved, and yet the weakest of species, those who should still have been wrapped in swaddling cloths yet were born in a land where dragons did dance, and so could only eke out survival in the shadow of ancient wings.

Thought they had long lost their guide, forgotten their past histories and memories, and lost themselves amidst mountain and wood, they endured still.

> [!jillian]
> This should be the humans living under the "protection" of dragons in the valley where the Mystics of the Night-Wind now live, as mentioned in [[Flute of Ezpitzal]]. I assume "the creator's most beloved" species is supposed to be humanity — and since the envoys have fallen, they have no one left to guide them. 

Marveling at their tenacity, unity, and courage, the sage amongst dragons resolved to grant them the flaming seed of wisdom. But that precious gift was not without cost. It would civilize these barbarians, but it would also order their destinies. For unlike the plan of that first divine one, what the most sage one brought was the profane path of "evolution." 

> [!jillian]
> In this version of the story, the seed *does* represent wisdom.

Its far sight had divined that at the end of that path, human blood would be poured into the derelict body of the moribund earth, merging two species and two bloodlines as one, and thus would an ancient pulse surge through a reborn civilization.

> [!jillian]
> The Sage's ultimate goal was to create a part-dragon, part-human species — presumably because he didn't think either the dragons or the humans were strong enough on their own.
> 
> I like that this is sort of [[Fertilizer Impact]].

Indeed, it would be as the wisest one said unto the first barbarian who climbed upon the floating landmass to visit it:

"But from your heirs shall come the savior of two worlds. He shall be brutal as a manticore, but as cunning as a wild fox.
"One day, he shall slay the overlord of fire and ascend to the oldest of thrones. Praise be unto the ruler of two worlds!"

> [!jillian]
> The "first barbarian" is [[Chaac]]. And the floating landmass he "climbed upon" is [[Records of Hanan Pacha|Hanan Pacha]].
> 
> I'm not sure, but I *think* the "two worlds" here refer to Teyvat and the Night Kingdom. And I guess what the Sage is seeing in the future might be the Archon War — ascending to the oldest of thrones?
## Myths of the Night Realm
>A mysterious ritual element that is neither a timepiece nor a compass. Nowadays, no one has any idea what it is used for.

In the years when ancient humans dammed up the black tide with their very bodies, in the days when floating land and eternal night still walked separate roads, many stories transpired that were never recorded or lauded in any human history.

> [!jillian]
> We know from [[Records of Hanan Pacha]] that "the days when floating land and eternal night still walked separate roads" is about the Sage trying to keep Hanan Pacha out of the control of the Lord of the Night.

All know that brave and wise [[Chaac]] took the ever-bright kindling from the hands of the Sage of the Stolen Flame, and that he shared this kindling with his fellow tribespeople, passing the secret of fire on to all who came forth to study it. Bidding farewell to long years of chaos and ignorance, the new sprouts of civilization sprung up once more from untamed wilderness. But within their massive walls, the winged ones who lorded it over all had yet to realize that the wheel of fate had begun to turn.

> [!jillian]
> [Chaac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaac) is a Maya god of rain, thunder, and lightning. There's a story about him opening up the mountain containing maize, which kinda fits with this theme of being the guy who gives his people what they need to prosper.
> 
> I like that "the winged ones" could be either the dragons or Celestia — or both.

Legend holds that the great Sage who dwelled in the stillness of the floating land knew the answer to all questions in the mortal world, but that even he had no answer to two matters: the end of the living, and the homeward path of the dead.

Perhaps it was that the gods of the night realm ruled over the underworld, for they were great foes of the sage in ancient days. Or perhaps his long-considered plan would crumble should the everlasting flame reconnect with the roots of the earth.

> [!jillian]
> So the Night Kingdom basically is the underworld, ruled over by gods. (Which gods?)
> 
> [[Records of Hanan Pacha]] says that the Lord of the Night *sent* the Sage to defeat the Volcano Lord. Meaning he was probably living in the Night Kingdom at the time. So what's this about them being "great foes" in the ancient days?
> 
> The everlasting flame *did* kind of reconnect with the roots of the earth in the end — when he made everyone leave Hanan Pacha and go back to Teyvat, they took the Sacred Flame with them and spread it to the rest of Natlan.

Having mastered the majestic primal flame, fearless [[Chaac]] and his companions at least defeated that raging, wicked dragon, and founded the first tribe. And yet even ancient heroes could not defy the verdict passed by time, for it is eternal, and so one by one, his companions bade him farewell.

> [!jillian]
> Which dragon is this? We mostly hear about the self-proclaimed Volcano Lord, but in the other version of this story, he's already been killed by Chaac and the Sage. That version of the story also says the first tribe was founded on Hanan Pacha — but maybe this is the *real* first tribe, because it's the first one in Teyvat instead of in the sky.
> 
> This could just be a case of there being multiple versions of a story passed down through generations, with a few details that are slightly different depending on who tells it. In this version, Chaac is the hero of humanity and Hanan Pacha doesn't matter. In the other version, Chaac and the Sage work together until it becomes clear they no longer share a goal.

At last, only [[Chaac]] was left, a veteran of countless battles. His tribe had scattered, and none now sang of his saga. Only in the deepest nights could he hear that call from a faraway realm, as if to reignite the fading flame in his heart. 

> [!jillian]
> Maybe this isn't actually too different from the [[Records of Hanan Pacha]] version — his tribe was founded on Hanan Pacha, but eventually left and scattered throughout Natlan.
> 
> The "faraway realm" is the Night Kingdom.

On the last night of his life, he climbed a high mountain to ignite the first flame. He called out, hoping to reunite with his former companions. And the gods of the night realm responded. That night, people throughout the land seemed to hear voices from another world, like a mother's clear song, like the low whispers of old friends — the birth-cry of the first Wayob of the Night Kingdom.

> [!jillian] 
> If his companions are dead, and the Night Kingdom is the underworld, it makes sense that he ended up calling to the Night Kingdom when trying to reunite with them. 
> 
> The reason he's able to do this is because he drank the alcohol from the Lord of the Night.
## Pre-Banquet of the Contenders
>A vessel that seems to have been made by twisting and forming stone in a seemingly whimsical fashion. But it is an open question as to who possesses such strength...

In the age where the burning realm's horns resounded never-ending, where heroes fought each other for conquest, many stories transpired that were never recorded or lauded in any human history.

When the priests of smoke and mist lit bonfires tall enough to block out the sun and offered the blood of other species to their valiant ancestors and invisible deities; When the hero who had drawn from the flame rode [[Scroll of the Hero of Cinder City|a tamed beast]] to the fortress built from massive stones through the guidance of the tribal Wayob; When the ancient crawling insects that dwelled within an ancient city scaled its twisted towers in terror, only the wisest among dragons stood within the stagnant void, a silent observer of the grand, drawn-out tragedy.

Though the envoy of dusk was not part of its plan, the path of "evolution" did not thus deviate. And through careful selection and cultivation, the tribal heroes it had nurtured had ascended to the stage of competition between all parties. It believed that the strongest amongst them would become the hero who would rule all human tribes dwelling atop the black stone. In his name, they would make a covenant, raise a banner of the blazing sun, and march upon the city of deep wells, that even gods had yet to conquer.

> [!jillian]
> It seems like this is happening much later — the Sage is still watching humanity from wherever he sits in the Night Kingdom. I'm not sure who the "envoy of dusk" is or what they did to shake up his big plans.
> 
> This is super speculative, but I wonder if "the tribal heroes it had nurtured" are the first Saurians, based on his involvement in [[Maawe and Monetoo]]. That said, the competition part sounds more like the humans in Natlan & the birth of their tournament.
> 
> The Sage seems to think that the winner of the tournament becomes the Pyro Archon. (The banner of the blazing sun definitely sounds like the Pyro Archon's banner to me.)
> 
> I'm not sure what "the city of deep wells" is. It doesn't seem like it would be the Night Kingdom, but also doesn't really sound like the Abyss. It's also mentioned in Perinheri, though — so maybe it has something to do with Khaenri'ah.

On that day, the living corpse on the throne would spit forth flame that could stain the sky red, and the new king would receive the primal flame as a tribute due them for ascension. On that day, the dragons would once more bow before the overlord of two worlds, and the knowledge of countless years of civilization would be open to him.

For it knew that the foes in the shadows were not far off. Indeed, they still hid in the night's deepest depths, waiting to strike a final blow. For it knew that neither the gods in their heavens nor the high king among dragons would suffice — all knowledge and strength had to be gathered before that day came.

> [!jillian]
> I think this is probably talking about [[Xiuhcoatl]] (a "living corpse" because he's asleep, also probably the Pryo Sovereign) and the day [[Xbalanque]] defeated him and became the first Pyro Archon ("the new king"). 
> 
> The Sage of Sacred Flame knew the whole time that neither the Primordial One nor Nibelung alone were enough to fight "the foes in the shadows" — which is why he gave the Sacred Flame (and therefore knowledge and strength) to humanity. 
> 
> I think this is similar to Pierro's ultimate goal (fitting that he's also a sage). I think he wants to take it a step further and create a being that is part-dragon, part-divine, part-human, and part-abyssal. 
> 
> The "foes in the shadows" could be the Night Kingdom, since it says they "hid in the night's deepest depths, waiting to strike a final blow" and they were already referred to as his "great foes." But it could also be the Abyss, hiding in the night realm.

Only by this could his stubborn kin awaken from the ancient, shattered dreams of a decrepit king. Only by this could the ancient civilization welcome suitable successors and find its footing once more on the earth.

> [!jillian] 
> Very curious about this — since I'm still not entirely sure what his origins are (Is he a dragon? Is he a human? Is he from the Night Kingdom? All of the above?) I'm also not entirely sure who his "stubborn kin" are. 
> 
> We know that there are dragons trapped in a dream (mentioned in [[Maawe and Monetoo]] and [[Flute of Ezpitzal]]). And apparently they're specifically trapped in the "dreams of a decrepit king" — Nibelung? (This is also reminding me of Durin's dream.) 
> 
> On the other hand, the Night Kingdom is basically a dreamworld, as far as I know. So his "stubborn kin" could also be other fallen envoys or something.
## Crown of the Saints
>A crown made of obsidian that in ancient times was used in coronation ceremonies by noble tribal kings.

In the era when the dark tide of filth arose from the sky's edge and heroes sun-bright marched forth to conquer, many stories transpired that were never recorded or lauded in any human history. 

> [!jillian]
> This "dark tide of filth" is mentioned throughout a lot of Natlan lore — I don't think it's referring to the cataclysm, because it seems to be much earlier in history, but it definitely sounds like an attack from the Abyss. In particular, it's the probably one mentioned in [[Talking Stick]]. 
> 
> I'm not sure yet if this is happening at the same time as whatever's going on in [[Scroll of the Hero of Cinder City]], but I suspect it's much earlier than that.

When human warriors bid farewell to their secluded villages and brought blessings of the Wayob to once-inaccessible, forbidden realms, the ancient dragons had become extinct from the fields they once ran upon, and the fruitful soil and springs had taken upon new colors.

The palaces and temples built upon magma cliffs lost their luster, now silently waiting for the judgment at the end of days. ==In this dreamlike realm, cut off from the world, the era of the ancients, too, drew nigh to an end.== And in the lightless lands of the night, the sacred ones continued their dissension over who would deliver this final verdict.

> [!jillian]
> I know I've been saying that I think the threat is the Abyss, but this makes me wonder if the Night Kingdom is seeping into Teyvat. (The next line makes me doubt that, tho — saying "And in the lightless lands of the night" kind of implies that we were not just talking about those same lightless lands.)
> 
> Who are the ancients? Who are the sacred ones? (My guess for the latter is the fallen envoys, the Wayob.) What is the final verdict and why are they fighting over who gets to deliver it?

[[Tenoch|He]] was a hero unprophesied, a champion unchronicled by any plan. This was a time when the war chiefs of the tribes had abandoned their great cause of slaying wicked dragons, vying power-drunk for supremacy; When their warriors plunged into endless warfare, leaning on savage beasts for support. And in those days from the dark lands rose a king bright as the newborn sun, warm as the budding dawn. He wore a crown woven from golden flowers, wielded [[Talking Stick|a great blade of obsidian]], and visited one tribe after another.

> [!jillian]
> If you read [[Talking Stick]], you can tell that this is pretty clearly about [[Tenoch]].

Disagreements born from blades can only be resolved by the blade, and delusion born from ambition can only be laid low by ambition still greater. And the one who had thought itself master over evolution never imagined that those with strength would give it an answer beyond conquest and slaughter.

> [!jillian] 
> He underestimated strength as a virtue. It sounds like he's actually witnessing the "evolution" he predicted — humans are no longer the barbarians they were when he first saw them. 

Under the sun's radiance did the tribes make a pact of ceasefire, and thus did the sacred ones of the night realm lay their arguments aside and offer him the crown. The dawn of a new era has emerged over the horizon, and when that light illuminates the earth, even the beasts of darkness shall have nowhere to hide.

> [!jillian] 
> The gravity of this makes it sound like Tenoch became the Pyro Archon or something — but we don't know what happened to the previous Pyro Archon.
> 
> On the other hand, Tenoch could be our classic God King of Natlan. The Decarabian, the Deshret, the Remus, etc. Always the founder of a great city, always the beginning of a new era, and usually associated with the [[Sun|sun]]. The Pyro Archon will likely have to clean up his mess.
> 
> Btw — the mention here that "the sacred ones of the night realm" offered him "the crown" is what makes me think that the Night Kingdom is the second world in the whole "savior of two worlds" thing. The "beasts of darkness" are definitely the Abyss.
