Here are a bunch of tools we use, for easy reference — some we've made, some we just like a lot.

## [Genshin Center](https://genshin-center.com)
I open this website every day. The ascension planner is so helpful for tracking what materials I have & what I need to build my characters. I don't know what I'd do without it. 

The achievement tracker is also really useful, and there's a handy link to the [Interactive Map](https://act.hoyolab.com/ys/app/interactive-map/index.html?lang=en-us#/map/2) — so you can get everything you need in one place.

## [Project Amber](https://ambr.top/en)
I really like using Project Amber for quickly referencing things. It's got a nicer interface than the Wiki, so it's my go-to for checking books, character materials, artifact lore, etc. It also has a changelog that makes it really easy to see which items & characters have been added in the most recent version.

## [Genshin Wizard](https://genshinwizard.com/)
This is a really nice Discord bot — it can do a lot of stuff. See your character builds, check your latest Spiral Abyss stats, redeem codes, etc. You can even set it up to automatically get your daily sign-in rewards from Hoyolab, which has been a lifesaver for me.

## [Resin Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T5Zf104LQSMlF4SU5DAFepVmn8KnGgVI_T9574aYnYU/edit?usp=sharing)
This is a little tool I made for a very specific purpose: if I know I need a certain amount of resin in a certain number of hours (maybe I have co-op plans or something), I use this to see how much resin I can use *now* to still have the amount I need later. 

## [TCG Deck Randomizer](https://tcg-rng.netlify.app/)
Another tool I made — this one just gives you a random TCG deck. You can also generate two random decks at a time to co-op with a friend. I'll do my best to keep this updated on time!

## [Random wiki page](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Random)
That link should take you to a random page from the Genshin wiki, which I sometimes like to do for inspo. Go nuts with it.
