## Theories
I have a bunch of silly Pierro theories that I'm still trying to make sense of. I think [[Lynette's hangout is about Pierro]]. I think [[Emilie's story quest is about Pierro]]. I think [[The Feline Firm]] is about him. I think he and [[Parsifal]] have a lot of similarities that I can't ignore. I think he and the [[Sage of Stolen Flame]] also have a lot of similarities that I can't ignore.

### What's he doing?
My best guess right now is that he's trying to revive the third descender or create a new descender. I wrote about this a little more extensively [[Emilie's story quest is about Pierro|here]]. Past that, I have absolutely no idea what his plan is. It sounds like he wants to do a hard reset on Teyvat by burning it all and starting over, but it's hard to tell what purpose that actually serves.

We could also compare his plan to the [[Sage of Stolen Flame]] — maybe Pierro also wants to sever humanity's ties to the night realm and ascend to the skies. Maybe he wants to break out of Teyvat and explore the cosmos. Maybe he's a dragon disguised as a human and he's not actually serving the Cryo Archon at all and wants to destroy Celestia and give authority back to the Sovereigns. I don't know.
## Pierro's silent war
This is a really good video, with a bunch of theories about Pierro & what his true goals might be. It didn't lead me to any conclusion, but gave me lots to chew on. And it also proved that I'm not the only person who things [[The Feline Firm]] is about Pierro.

I'm especially interested in the theory that Pierro has the ability to erase memories — and that he might have erased some of Arlecchino's memories, or erased the Abyss Sibling from Irminsul himself.

I also really enjoyed the chess part, of course.
