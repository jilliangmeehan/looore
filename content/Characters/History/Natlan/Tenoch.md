From [[Ash-Graven Drinking Horn]], it seems like Tenoch was once part of the People of the Springs tribe but left after losing a fight with [[Tupac]]. Tenoch apparently caused so much trouble around Natlan that all the tribes chased him away, and the chief of the mines (mentioned in [[Talking Stick]]) wanted the Pyro Archon to expel him.

As [[Obsidian Codex]] and [[Talking Stick]] tell us, Tenoch united all of the tribes together against the Abyss as an "unprophesied hero" wearing a "crown of golden flowers." He's likened to the [[Sun|sun]] a few times, and it also mentions that "the sacred ones of the night realm" offered him the crown. I have no idea what that means or what happened after that, but I wouldn't be surprised if this "crown" was an ancient name.

The timeline of these things don't really match up — I was under the assumption that the [[Obsidian Codex]] lore was earlier in history than the Archon War, which means there wouldn't have been a Pyro Archon to expel Tenoch from Natlan. If that's *not* true, and the [[Obsidian Codex]] story happens *after* the Archon War, then I find it kind of odd that Tenoch even had to step in to unite the tribes in the first place — why would we crown a new king as the savior of two worlds if we already have a Pyro Archon?

Given all that, there's a part of me that thinks *maybe* [[Obsidian Codex]] and [[Talking Stick]] are not about the exact same moment in history. Maybe the former is about an ancestor of Tenoch's who passed the weapon down to him, and he's meant to fulfill a similar duty hundreds of years later.

> Obviously those last two paragraphs are wrong. [[Obsidian Codex]] and [[Talking Stick]] are both about the cataclysm 500 years ago, and the reason the Pyro Archon wasn't there is because Mavuika was sleeping.
