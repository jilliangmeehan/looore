## Name
The name "Waxaklahun Ubah Kan" is the Maya name for [Kukulkan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kukulkan), a serpent deity. Kukulkan is also thought to be a version of [Qʼuqʼumatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q%CA%BCuq%CA%BCumatz) and [Quetzalcōātl](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quetzalc%C5%8D%C4%81tl). All three of them are some version of the [Vision Serpent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_Serpent), a creature that acts as a direct link between the spirit realm & the human realm. 

The Vision Serpent also apparently sits on top of the World Tree. If we compare with the Norse version, that would make him [Hræsvelgr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hr%C3%A6svelgr), the eagle who sits on top of Yggdrasil. But this guy actually reminds me more of [Ratatoskr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatoskr), the squirrel that runs up and down the tree carrying messages between the eagles at the top & the serpent at the bottom.

## Human or dragon?
[[Records of Hanan Pacha]] mentions that the Sage was a human. In other stories, he's referred to as a dragon.
