Chaac was a human who either teamed up with the [[Sage of Stolen Flame]] to defeat the Volcano Lord, or was given the Sacred Flame to share with the people of Natlan after the fact, depending on which version of the story you read ([[Records of Hanan Pacha]] vs. [[Obsidian Codex]]). 

He founded the first human tribe, and also made the first contact with the Wayob of the night realm.
