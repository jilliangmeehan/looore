Tupac's ancestor was Uenuku, the owner of the [[Footprint of the Rainbow]], and presumably the one who founded the People of the Springs tribe.

He was known for being "built like a mountain," and he was [[Tenoch]]'s rival until they [[Talking Stick|teamed up]] with a group of heroes to fight the Abyss together. Sometime before that, he challenged Tenoch to a fight over the [[Ash-Graven Drinking Horn]] (and won). He later offered that drinking horn up as a sacrifice to fulfill a promise or something.

He also passed his ancient name on to Mualani.
