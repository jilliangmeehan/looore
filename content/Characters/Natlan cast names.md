We have names and faces for the Natlan cast! Let's look at them.

> fair warning that this is mostly the result of me typing these names into wikipedia and seeing what comes up. 
## Mualani
![[mualani.webp]]
[Mualani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mualani) is the name of a Hawaiian High Chiefess and princess of Ko'olau. In Hawaiian, *mua* = first, and *lani* = heaven/sky.
## Kachina
![[kachina.webp]]
The [kachina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kachina) is a Pueblo spirit — usually a personification of something (an element, a location, a type of food, the sun, etc). 

They came up from the underworld, helped people out for a bit, and then returned to the underworld — either because they were attacked and killed, or because people lost respect for them. When they left, people began impersonating them with masks, costumes, and dolls to recreate the happiness they brought.
## Kinich
![[kinich.webp]]
[Kinich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinich_Ahau) is the Yucatec and Lacandon name for the Maya [[Sun|sun]] god. A few interesting notes on that Wikipedia page:

> It may be noted that the [Hero Twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_Twins "Hero Twins"), Hunahpu and Xbalanque, although stated to have changed into Sun and Moon, are never shown assimilated to God G. (God G is another name referring to Kinich here.)

> The sun deity can be shown as a king (_ajaw_) seated high on a throne cushion (...)
## Ajaw
![[ajaw.webp]]
As mentioned above, "[Ajaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajaw)" is a Mayan word — seems like it can be used to refer to any type of noble (including priests).
## Citlali
![[citlali.webp]]
[Citlālicue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citl%C4%81licue) is the closest I can find here, I think — she's an Aztec goddess who created the stars, the Earth, death, and darkness with her husband. Sometimes she and her husband are associated with the first pair of humans, Nata and Nena.
## Xilonen
![[xilonen.webp]]
Xilonen is one of the names of [Chicōmecōātl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicomec%C5%8D%C4%81tl), an Aztec goddess of agriculture. Her name apparently means "Seven Serpent."

> While she symbolizes the gathering of maize and agricultural prosperity, she also is thought to be harmful to the Aztecs, as she was thought to be of blame during years of poor harvest.
## Chasca
![[chasca.webp]]
Ch'aska (who doesn't have her own Wikipedia page, but is listed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Inca_mythology)) is the Incan goddess of dawn and beauty. She has a lot of similarities with Venus. Her name also means "morning star."
## Mavuika
![[mavuika.webp]]
[Mahuika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahuika) is a pretty obvious source of inspiration for this one — the Maori fire deity. A few interesting notes about her:

- Sometimes she's depicted as the younger sister of the [goddess of death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hine-nui-te-p%C5%8D)
- [Māui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ui_) learned the secrets of making fire from her burning fingernails
- There's a story about her getting the [god of earthquakes and eruptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C5%ABaumoko) to destroy [an island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangitoto_Island) on her behalf because of a shapeshifting couple there who cursed her

> mavuika is clearly a himeko expy, as expected. but it's notable that she hasn't been referred to *as* himeko at all + she doesn't share the same JP VA as the other himekos usually do. knowing that mahuika is the younger sister of another goddess, i wonder if himeko was the *first* pyro archon who has already died — and mavuika is her younger sister.

## Iansan
![[iansan.webp]]
Also known as [Ọya](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E1%BB%8Cya), Iansa is a Yoruba deity of rivers and storms. She is often depicted as a buffalo, and is the patron of the Niger river. 
## Ororon
![[ororon.webp]]
This one is hard — the name might be a reference to [_Oroonoko_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oroonoko), which I have not read although it sounds crazy. The general synopsis is that Prince Oroonoko is tricked & captured by a European slave trader, and is then reunited with his former lover who he *thought* was dead but who had also just been sold into slavery. He eventually organizes a failed slave revolt, and then he and his lover decide that he has to kill *her* so she doesn't face any worse repercussions for his actions later, or something. And then naturally he dies a gruesome, heroic death at the end.

The other thing I found is a manga called [The Demon Ororon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Demon_Ororon), which is about the human daughter of the archangel Michael falling in love with Ororon, the King of Hell (who has abandoned his throne). It sounds very interesting, lol. 

I guess the general theme here is you have some kind of noble who just wants to settle down with the girl he loves but cannot escape the violence & death that surrounds him as he tries to keep her safe. I'm also side-eyeing the very obvious quantum symbols on his scarf & hand.
