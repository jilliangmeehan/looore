something i keep noticing about artifact lore is that it's rarely linear. reading from [[flower of life]] to [[circlet of logos]] is never going to tell you a story from beginning to end. and even if you try to piece them together in the right order, you never really know if you're doing it correctly or not — there could be pieces within the description for *one artifact* that are told out of order. 

some artifacts tell stories of things that haven't happened yet (i realized this when revisiting [[husk of opulent dreams]] after we progressed through scaramouche's story more), so we can never really assume *what* has happened *when.* some sets, like [[resolution of sojourner]], do help fill in the gaps for events we know have already occurred in teyvat's history. on the other hand, who's to say the [[berserker]] isn't someone we'll encounter in the future?
