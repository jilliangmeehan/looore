## Notes
This book gives a little look at the creation of one of the Saurians, the first Koholasaur. A few of the most interesting things mentioned:
- The dragons used to have different tribes in Natlan, ruled by matriarchs
- Monetoo, Tepetlisaurs, and Qucusaurs also already existed during this time — there is a mention of humans, but it doesn't sound like they've formed any tribes yet
- Following a war with the heavens, the dragons were very proud & wanted to recapture their nobility by seeking "fury"
- A bunch of dragons seemed to be trapped in a "dreamland" — Maawe escaped the dreamland by being awoken by its Monetoo companion's song
- The [[Sage of Stolen Flame]] is out there chilling somewhere behind an obsidian gate — this could mean he's in the Night Kingdom

Tiny, fun little theory is that the order the Saurians were created mirrors the order the seven archons were born: the geo one first, then the anemo one, and then the hydro one. 
### Questions
My biggest question is about the timeline — if the humans haven't formed any tribes yet, that means the Sage hasn't given them the Sacred Flame yet. But he *is* already known as "the wise dragon," and it sounds like he might be somewhere in the Night Kingdom, judging by the obsidian gate. 

Maybe it's just a matter of not taking everything too literally & not getting caught up on tiny details in different stories not quite matching up. I suppose my best guess is that this all takes place before the Sage goes to steal the Sacred Flame.
## Content
> A woven scroll from the People of the Springs telling of how Maawe the Saurian whelp created the hot spring. Different paragraphs of this seem to have been penned by poets of different eras.
### Volume I
Legends tell that in a time long past, proud dragons roamed freely across the expanses of Natlan, a land they called their home. Back then, before the humans of this land had formed their tribes, dragons were both larger and haughtier than the Saurians of the present day. 

==Just as humans do now, the dragons had different tribes of their own, each ruled by ancient matriarchs.== Back then, there were no hot springs that bubbled up from the earth, no lakes that glittered as calmly and clearly as gemstones. Oh, and certainly none of those clamorous wandering bards or phlegmatic hot spring poets. 

> [!jillian]
> Interesting note that all the dragon tribes were ruled by matriarchs.

Back then, among the dragons that roamed this vast land of crimson earth, there was a young one that was not like the others. ==In their pride, dragons have always looked down upon the other beings of this world, whether they were envoys of the heavens or puny mortal souls.== 

Even the wars of old could not erase their sense of overweening dignity; on the contrary, it was through these very fires of tribulation that their tenacity and pride were forged. But this young dragon was different. It was fascinated by the songs of the Monetoo, and in secret was even given to observing human behavior. ==Its name was Maawe, which in an ancient, long-forgotten language, meant "bit of string."==

> First of all, this section is hinting that there have already been wars between the dragons and (potentially) the heavens. 
> 
> Second of all, the Monetoo existed as far back as the age when the dragons were still roaming around Natlan. I still don't know if they have any relation to seelies at all — they're kind of like seelies, but made out of phlogiston instead of pure elemental energy? But I don't know if they have any further similarities.
> 
> And third of all, I like this definition of Maawe's name. "Bit of string" reminds me of Ariadne guiding Theseus out of the labyrinth — so maybe this fits with the People of the Springs being known as guides.

Young Maawe had not lived through the ancient wars and could not understand the "virtues" of dragonkind. As far as it was concerned, nothing was more pleasing than cool moonlit nights and the warm shadows of red cliffs. 

"Such blatant indolence! How can this be tolerated in the Dragonlord's Palace? The puerile whelp must rediscover the ambition and fury of its noble heritage." Thus spake the dragon matriarch, decreeing that the young Maawe must leave the tribe to grow up like a "real dragon"— to harden its heart, to become as tenaciously proud as obsidian, and to be guided alone by cruel, lofty ambition...

### Volume II

> [!jillian] 
> I looooove that after the ending of that last part, the second volume is written much more like a poem or a song. (There's a note at the top that different volumes were written by different people.)

And thus, utterly alone, did Maawe step out into the boundless red wilderness. 
Just like a real dragon, it would endure the trials of scorching sun and desolation, 
Seeking out noble ambition and fury whilst cultivating a prideful, virtuous nature. 
In its wake followed the same Monetoo that had ==accompanied it through all those innocent dreams,== 
And on a journey to find fury they set out together, perhaps not so lonely after all. 

> [!jillian]
> I wonder if this means the Monetoo *literally* accompanied it through dreams? Related to the Night Kingdom? 
> 
> It says the dragons roamed all over Natlan in this age, and we can tell from the directions Maawe goes that they at least started their journey in a kinda central location, *maybe* more toward the west. There's also a later section that mentions them going to the foggy "dreamland," so I'm guessing they didn't start there. 

Eastward Maawe trekked, towards the high mountains shrouded in sulfurous clouds. 
There it reached the canyons, there it stood before the pitch-black mines. 
Seeing its brethren seeking shiny crystals within the mountain, Maawe called out to greet them, 
But from that jet black cavern, the only response was the echo of Maawe's own voice. 
It turned out that these kinfolk had long since accustomed themselves to the still and silence around them, 
Now reduced to being creatures that lurked among the mountain rocks. 
Fury was not to be found among these rocks, so Maawe shrugged and left. 

> [!jillian]
> Tepetlisaurs in the area that is now home to the Children of Echoes — so these were already around.
> 
> It did mention that the dragons all had tribes, which I assumed correlated to the human tribes that are currently in Natlan. But if that's true, does this mean some of the tribes have turned into Saurians? 

Westward Maawe headed, to the long-dead forest of mirk and gloom. 
Passing the bones of its ancestors, it paid respect like a real dragon would. 
Before that grand palace woven from countless branches Maawe arrived. 
Seeing its brethren flying freely through the canopy, Maawe called out to greet them, 
But heard only the wind's rustling and swaying branches in return. 
It turned out that these kinfolk had long since accustomed themselves to the still and silence around them, 
Now reduced to being creatures that silently stalked the forest depths. 
Fury was not to be found by chasing Forest Boars, so Maawe shrugged and left. 

> [!jillian]
> This sounds like it's probably about the Qucusaurs in the area that is now home to the Flower-Feather Clan, although it's hard to say for sure since we haven't been there yet.

Southward Maawe rambled, to the brown prairies where rivers had dried up. 
==Past the remnants of old dreams, those shattered aspirations of youth,== 
And past the most ancient of cherished hopes, faded through age and degradation. 
Traversing a smoke-shrouded wasteland, ==Maawe stood before its brethren, 
Seeing that they had fallen into distant dreams among the fog, Maawe called out to greet them, 
And they responded warmly, inviting Maawe to join them in their wondrous dreaming.== 
"Our brother, distinguished guest from afar — stay here, we implore you! 
Stay in our dreamland, and join us in creating past and present. 
Stay in our dreamland, and join us in dreaming of a wonderful tomorrow." 
The glorious past and future of dragonkind shone forth, lit up by the miraculous luster of their fantasy. 
But just as it was about to succumb to this enchantment, ==Maawe awoke to the sound of its companion's song.== 
Fury was not to be found by dreaming, so Maawe shrugged and left. 

> [!jillian] 
> Since they can talk to Maawe, they must be actual dragons. And it sounds like they're stuck in the Night Kingdom or something.
> 
> The Moneto's song can awaken you from the dream of the Night Kingdom — maybe like the Ode to Resurrection?
> 
> Anyway, I don't totally know where this is geographically but I'm assuming it's where the Night-Wind tribe now lives — which is also the area where dragons first "protected" humans in exchange for sending sacrifices into the Night Kingdom to guide them through their dreams.

Northward Maawe wandered, to the untrodden edges of the land. 
Past the lavaflow delta, across the silent, blistering wilderness. 
Past the land where burning spirits danced, through the gate of stern black stone. 
Finally, Maawe and its companion arrived before the wise dragon, sat high upon its throne. 
"Young one, for what purpose have you come before me?" 
Thus mildly did the wise dragon address Maawe, marveling at what it saw. 
"I thought that my brethren's hearts had all been hardened by ==the war with the heavens,== 
That the hatred that filled them had made them impervious to my advice. 
Yet today comes one before me, and such a young one at that. 
Tell me, what do you seek? Perhaps I might grant it as an exception." 

> [!jillian]
> The "wise dragon" is probably the [[Sage of Stolen Flame]]. This land in the north with the obsidian gate sounds interesting — I guess that's where he lives. I wonder if that means he lives in the Night Kingdom, since you pass through obsidian pillars to get there. (I wonder why & when he went back, since [[Records of Hanan Pacha]] seems to imply that he wouldn't.)
> 
> Also mentions "the war with the heavens." I know it was long enough ago that Maawe doesn't remember it.

So Maawe told the wise dragon the whole story of its journey, 
Of the dreams it had once cherished, and cool moonlit nights, 
Of warm shadows of red cliffs, and the songs of the Monetoo, 
Of being exiled by the matriarch, and setting out in search of elusive fury. 
"Young one... A heart so artless, yet so audacious, 
You come before me seeking what I too cannot obtain. 
Leave this place. You shall not find the fury you seek here." 
Closing its obsidian gate, the wise dragon answered Maawe no more.

### Volume III
So did the wise dragon's obsidian gate close for Maawe, and so disappointed, Maawe left. As they descended the mountain, ==the Monetoo — having accompanied Maawe all this way — began to lose its light and warmth, being far from phlogiston-rich lands as it was. It turned as pale as ash, and its song grew distant and faint.== Despondent and begrieved, Maawe desperately sought a way to save its companion. But still the obsidian gate stayed firmly shut, the wise dragon undeigning to behold the youngling again. 

> [!jillian]
> Reminds me of the Simulanka residents losing the color of their paper as they forgot their memories. Light = memories = life = power. 
> 
> Also reminds me of Inteyvat petals turning to stone when they leave their homeland.

"...Scatter me in a pool of sulfur, bury me in the icy depths..." 

This was the voice that Maawe heard. Monetoo are unable to speak, but Maawe did not know this. And so, it decided to fulfill its companion's wish. After walking for untold hours, seeing through countless mirages, and surviving innumerable trials of deadly peril, Maawe arrived at a hot spring full of sulfurous pools. 

> [!jillian]
> I'm assuming that the voice is the [[Sage of Stolen Flame]] attempting to help Maawe. I wonder if he had something to do with the creation of the other two existing Saurians mentioned here, too.

Uninhabitable for living beings, it was a place where even getting close might result in being burned by toxic gases and scorched by boiling acid. But miraculously, as Maawe scattered its companion's form into the sulfur, the boiling acid transformed into a clear spring before its very eyes. It was from this spring that the first poets of our tribe were born. 

> [!jillian]
> The Monetoo absorbed all the bad stuff — and created the future home of the People of the Springs.

As we Meztli say, "Poets and bards are born of sulfur" — for their words are scalding indeed. So did the young Maawe create Natlan's first hot spring. And so did Maawe make the hot spring its home. Its four limbs transformed into beautifully streamlined fins, its thin body became round, and thus it became the first of the Koholasaurs. 

Of course, Maawe did not forget its companion. ==How could it have forgotten the friend that had journeyed with it all that way?== Maawe passed on all of the songs it had heard and learned to the humans born from the springs. That's right — to our ancestors. And to this day, the songs that we Meztli continue to pass down are echoes from that ancient era.

> [!jillian] 
> So the Monetoo sacrificed itself, and Maawe honored that sacrifice by making sure its story was remembered in songs.
