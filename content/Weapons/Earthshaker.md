> A heavy blade that people claim was beloved by the hero known as the Firethief. They say even the Lord of Cinder Keep's flames could not burn it away.

Long, long ago, in what now is seen as an age of myth, when great dragons still soared above the canopy, there lived a hero who — though later came to be revered as the Firethief — was at that time still in his youth, and as reckless as a Halberd-Crest Bird.

Born strong, brave, and boastful, he would roam the woods, challenging passersby to duels, yet he was easily defeated by a half-human hero, the follower of a great warrior, who with cunning footwork lured him into a mire.

Seeing the young man in such a sorry state, the archer could not help but laugh; Of habit so stern and taciturn, you would not have thought that the mixed-blood would tease others so. Half of shame, half of annoyance, the young man made up his mind; He would follow these oddballs, if only to cover up the shame of defeat.

"Hey! You aren't seriously thinking of taking on that...uh, whatever it is, without me, are you?"

"Listen up, you lot! I am Yupanqui, and it is I that is destined to shake the very foundations of the...wait, I haven't finished!"

Many years later, whenever he thought back upon that journey, he couldn't help laughing at how awkwardly childish he used to be. More than once did his failure to heed advice land him in great danger; more than once did his boisterousness earn him the quiet artisan's annoyance.

>  This is how he knew of the craftsman that he told everyone about in [[Unfinished Reverie]]. Is he the half-human hero, or the great warrior? 

Though it is true that countless enemies fell to the swings of his greatsword, on balance, his contributions were still outweighed by the trouble he caused. Despite this, the companions who journeyed by the warrior's side tolerated his youthful ignorance. When his vision was taken by the fire of delirium, it seemed to him that he heard the silent priest's words once more...

> I wonder who this "silent priest" is. And when did he hear these words for the first time?

"One day, you will understand why you embarked on this verdant path."

"By past fuel, and present flame, life marches ever on."
