### The Fool

The Fool is titled _Le Mat_ in the [Tarot of Marseilles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot_of_Marseilles), and _Il Matto_ in most Italian language tarot decks. These [archaic words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaism) mean "the madman" or "the beggar", and may be related to the word for 'checkmate' in relation to the original use of tarot cards for gaming purposes.

The Fool holds a white rose (a symbol of freedom from baser desires) in one hand, and in the other a small bundle of possessions, representing untapped collective knowledge.

In many esoteric systems of [tarot card interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot_card_reading), the Fool is interpreted as the protagonist of a story, and the Major Arcana are the path the Fool takes through the great mysteries of life. This path is known traditionally in cartomancy as the "Fool's Journey", and is frequently used to introduce the meaning of Major Arcana cards to beginners.

Folly, mania, extravagance, intoxication, delirium, frenzy, [bewrayment](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bewrayment). [If the card is] Reversed: Negligence, absence, distribution, carelessness, apathy, nullity, vanity.

### The Magician
Waite's magician features the infinity symbol over his head, and an [ouroboros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros) belt, both symbolizing eternity. The figure stands among a garden of flowers, to imply the manifestation and cultivation of desires.

The Magician is depicted with one hand pointing upwards towards the sky and the other pointing down to the earth, interpreted widely as an "[as above, so below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_above,_so_below)" reference to the spiritual and physical realms. On the table before him are a wand, a pentacle, a sword, and a cup, representing the four suits of the [Minor Arcana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_Arcana).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magician_(tarot_card)?useskin=vector#cite_note-biddytarot-6) Such symbols signify the [classical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_elements) of fire, earth, air, and water, "which lie like counters before the adept, and he adapts them as he wills".

The Magician's right hand, pointed upwards, holds a double-ended white wand; the ends are interpreted much like the hand gestures, in that they represent the Magician's status as conduit between the spiritual and the physical. His robe is similarly also white, a symbol of purity yet also of inexperience, while his red [mantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(clothing)) is understood through the lens of red's wildly polarised colour symbolism—both a representative of willpower and passion, and one of egotism, rage, and revenge.

In front of the Magician is a garden of [Rose of Sharon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_of_Sharon) roses and [lily of the valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_of_the_valley) lilies[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magician_(tarot_card)?useskin=vector#cite_note-9) demonstrating the "culture of aspiration", or the Magician's ability to cultivate and fulfill potential.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magician_(tarot_card)?useskin=vector#cite_note-KeyTarot-7)

According to [A. E. Waite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._E._Waite)'s 1910 book [_Pictorial Key To The Tarot_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pictorial_Key_to_the_Tarot), the Magician card is associated with the divine motive in man. In particular, Waite interprets the Magician through a [Gnostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism) lens, linking the card's connection with the number eight (which the [infinity symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_symbol) is visually related to) and the Gnostic concept of the [Ogdoad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogdoad_(Gnosticism)), spiritual rebirth into a hidden eighth celestial realm. Said infinity symbol above the Magician's head is also interpreted as a symbol of the [Holy Spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Spirit), the prophetic and [theophanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophany) aspect of the [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity).

While the upright Magician represents potential and tapping into one's talents, the reversed Magician's potential and talents are unfocused and unmanifested.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magician_(tarot_card)?useskin=vector#cite_note-biddytarot-6) The reversed Magician can also be interpreted as related to [black magick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_magick) and to madness or mental distress.

### The High Priestess
In the [Rider–Waite Tarot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider%E2%80%93Waite_Tarot), illustrated by [Pamela Coleman Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_Colman_Smith), the Popess was changed into The High Priestess sitting between the pillars of [Boaz and Jachin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boaz_and_Jachin) (which has a particular meaning to [Freemasonry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry)). She wears a crown similar to the Egyptian goddess [Hathor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hathor) and is depicted with the [Marian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary,_mother_of_Jesus) imagery of a blue mantle and the [moon at her feet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_of_the_Apocalypse). [A. E. Waite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._E._Waite), the co-creator of the Rider–Waite deck, dismissed the idea that the card originally depicted [Pope Joan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Joan) and speculated that it was instead connected to the ancient cult of [Astarte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astarte).

The "Flemish Deck" by Vandenborre (c. 1750-1760) refers to this card as _Le Espagnol Capitano Eracasse_ ("The Spanish Captain Fracasse"), after a version of [Il Capitano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Capitano), a character from [_Commedia dell'Arte_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commedia_dell%27Arte)

In the Rider–Waite (aka Rider-Waite-Smith) deck, upon which many modern decks are based, The High Priestess is identified with the [Shekhinah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shekhinah), the female indwelling presence of the divine.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Priestess?useskin=vector#cite_note-Waite1910-6) She wears plain blue robes and sits with her hands in her lap. She has a [lunar crescent at her feet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_of_the_Apocalypse), "a horned [diadem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diadem) on her head, with a globe in the middle place"[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Priestess?useskin=vector#cite_note-Waite1910-6) similar to the crown of the ancient Egyptian goddess [Hathor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hathor), but with the horns having a shape more like half-crescents, and a large cross on her breast, the balance between the four elements: fire, water, earth, and air.

The scroll in her hands, partly covered by her mantle, bears the letters TORA (meaning "divine law"), that symbolizes the memory we carry inside about the past, present and future, named [Akasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akasha). She is seated between the white and black pillars—'J' and 'B' for [Jachin and Boaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jachin_and_Boaz)—of the mystic [Temple of Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Solomon). The veil of the Temple is behind her: it is embroidered with palm leaves (male) and [pomegranates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomegranate) (female),[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Priestess?useskin=vector#cite_note-Burke_1985_pp._35%E2%80%9336-7) growing on a tree shaped like the [tree of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life#Kabbalah).

The motif that hangs behind the High Priestess’s throne, veiling whatever mysteries she guards, is suggested in the pattern of [The Empress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empress_(Tarot_card))' gown. The two are sisters, one bringing life into the world, the other inviting the living to the esoteric mysteries. Further behind all of that is what seems to be a body of water, most probably the sea.

Secrets, mystery, the future as yet unrevealed; the woman who interests the Querent, if male; the Querent herself, if female; silence, tenacity; mystery, wisdom, science. Reversed: Passion, moral or physical ardor, conceit, surface knowledge.

### The Empress
The Empress sits on a throne wearing a [crown with twelve stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_of_the_Apocalypse), holding a [scepter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scepter) in one hand. The scepter is representative of her power over life, her crown has twelve stars representing her dominance over the year, and her throne is in the midst of a field of grain, representative of her dominion over growing things. The Empress is representative of the productivity of the subconscious, seeded by ideas. She is meant to be the embodiment of the growth of the natural world, fertility, and what one knows or believes from the heart.

The Empress can be represented by [Aphrodite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite), a figure from Greek mythology. The empress connects with the [Death card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(Tarot_card)), for she is accustomed to life, death and rebirth.

The Empress is a mother, a creator, and nurturer. In many decks she can be shown as pregnant. She can represent the creation of life, romance, art, or business. The Empress can represent the germination of an idea before it is ready to be fully born, and the need to be receptive to change.

The Empress is associated with the planet Venus in astrology.

Fruitfulness, action, initiative, length of days; the unknown, clandestine; also difficulty, doubt, ignorance. Reversed: Light, truth, the unraveling of involved matters, public rejoicings; according to another reading, vacillation.

### The Emperor
The [Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor) sits on a ram-adorned throne, a symbol of [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_(mythology)). Another ram head can be seen on his cloak. His long white beard bears the symbol of "wisdom".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor_(tarot_card)?useskin=vector#cite_note-1) He holds an [Ankh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankh) scepter in his right hand, and a globe, symbol of domination, in his left. The Emperor sits atop a stark, barren mountain, a sign of "sterility of regulation, and unyielding power."[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor_(tarot_card)?useskin=vector#cite_note-2) He symbolizes the top of the secular hierarchy, the ultimate male [ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego). The Emperor is the absolute ruler of the world.

The Emperor Keywords

UPRIGHT: Authority, establishment, structure, a father figure

REVERSED: Domination, excessive control, lack of discipline, inflexibility

  

**the hierophant**

In many modern packs, the [Hierophant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierophant) is represented with his right hand raised in blessing or benediction, with two fingers pointing skyward and two pointing down, thus forming a bridge between [Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven) and [Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell) reminiscent of that formed by the body of [The Hanged Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hanged_Man_(tarot_card)).

  

The Hierophant is thus a true "pontiff", in that he is the builder of the bridge between deity and humanity. In his left hand he held a [triple cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_cross).

  

In most iconographic depictions, the Hierophant is seen seated on a throne between two pillars symbolizing [Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law) and [Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom) or obedience and disobedience, according to different interpretations. He wears a triple crown, and the keys to Heaven are at his feet. Sometimes he is shown with worshippers, as his alternate title is the [Pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope) or, sometimes, [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_(mythology)).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hierophant?useskin=vector#cite_note-1) The card is also known as "The High Priest", as a counterpart to "The High Priestess" (which itself is also sometimes known as "The Papess", as counterpart to "The Pope").

  

According to de Gébelin, "hierophant" was the title of the chief priest in the [Eleusinian mysteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusinian_mysteries) (an ancient Greek ritual). However, historical evidence shows that tarot cards were invented in Northern Italy in the first half of the 15th century and not in ancient Egypt.

  

Marriage, alliance, captivity, servitude; by another account, mercy, and goodness; inspiration; the man to whom the Querent has recourse. Reversed: Society, good understanding, concord, over kindness, weakness.

  

**the lovers**

Attraction, love, beauty, trials overcome. _Reversed:_ Failure, foolish designs. Another account speaks of marriage frustrated and contrarieties of all kinds.

  

In some traditions, the Lovers represent relationships and choices. Its appearance in a spread indicates some decision about an existing relationship, a [temptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temptation) of the heart, or a choice of potential partners. Often an aspect of the Querent's life will have to be sacrificed; a [bachelor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor)(ette)'s lifestyle may be sacrificed and a relationship gained (or vice versa), or one potential partner may be chosen while another is turned down. Whatever the choice, it should not be made lightly, as the ramifications will be lasting.

  

The Lovers is associated with the [star sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac) [Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(astrology)), and indeed is also known as **The Twins** in some decks. Other associations are with [Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_(classical_element)), [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)), and the [Hebrew letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_alphabet) **ז** ([Zayin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zayin)).

  

Instead of a couple receiving a blessing from a noble or cleric, the Rider–Waite deck depicts [Adam and Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve) in the [Garden of Eden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden).

  

The Rider–Waite card also includes the [Tree of the knowledge of good and evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil) with a serpent wrapped around its trunk. The symbolism of no return from making bad decisions, and the consequences of innocence lost, would be more widely understood from this imagery.

  

**the chariot**

A figure sits in a [chariot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariot), although he holds no rope, he is pulled by two [sphinxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx) or horses. There is often a black and white motif, for example one of the steeds may be black and the other white. The figure may be crowned or helmeted, and is winged in some representations. The figure may hold a sword or wand. The [Thoth Tarot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoth_Tarot) deck has the figure controlling four animals.

  

The [mallet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallet), or [gavel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavel), on the chariot's coat of arms is a [masonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masonic) symbol representing self control.

  

A canopy of stars above the charioteer's head is intended to show "celestial influences".

  

Succour, providence; also war, triumph, presumption, vengeance, trouble. Reversed: Riot, quarrel, dispute, litigation, defeat.

  

In [Astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology), the Chariot is associated with the feminine, cardinal-water [sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_sign) of [Cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_(astrology)) and its ruling planetary body, the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_(astrology)).

  

Other names for the card are **The Centurion** or **Victory**.

  

**justice**

The figure on the card holds a scale made of gold in their left hand, symbolizing a balanced decision.

  

Equity, rightness, probity, executive; triumph of the deserving side in law. Reversed: Law in all its departments, legal complications, bigotry, bias, excessive severity.

  

Justice is traditionally the eighth card, and [Strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_(Tarot_card)) the eleventh, but the influential [Rider–Waite–Smith deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider%E2%80%93Waite%E2%80%93Smith_deck) switched the position of these two cards in order to make them better fit the astrological correspondences worked out by the [Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn), under which the eighth card is associated with [Leo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(astrology)) and the eleventh with [Libra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libra_(astrology)).

  

**the hermit**

The [Rider–Waite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider%E2%80%93Waite_tarot_deck) version of the card shows an old man, standing on a mountain peak, carrying a staff in one hand and a lit [lantern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lantern) containing a [six-pointed star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_David) in the other. In the background is a mountain range.

  

According to [Eden Gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Gray), his lantern is the Lamp of Truth, used to guide the unknowing, his patriarch's staff helps him navigate narrow paths as he seeks enlightenment and his cloak is a form of discretion.

  

Prudence, circumspection; also and especially treason, dissimulation, roguery, corruption. _Reversed:_ Concealment, disguise, policy fear, unreasoned caution.

  

The card is usually thought to connote aspects of healing/recovery, particularly the kind that happens over time. In that regard, The Hermit is sometimes considered the mature and wiser version of [The Magician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magician_(Tarot_card)).

  

The Hermit is the "withdrawal from events and relationship to introspect and gather strength". Seeking the inner voice or calling upon vision from within. A need of understanding and advice, or a wise person who will offer knowing guidance. A card of personal experience and thoughtful temperance.

  

**wheel of fortune**

Destiny, fortune, success, elevation, luck, felicity. _Reversed:_ Increase, abundance, superfluity.

  

The _Wheel Of Fortune_ card, like other cards of the [Major Arcana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Arcana), varies widely in depiction between tarot decks. The card has been modeled ever since the tarot's inception in the 15th century after the medieval concept of [_Rota Fortunae_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rota_Fortunae), the wheel of the goddess [Fortuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortuna). Images generally show a six- or eight-spoked wheel, often attended or crested by an individual (sometimes human; sometimes a [Sphinx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx)-like half-human) attired in an Egyptian-style headdress. In some decks, such as the AG Müller, the wheel is also attended by an individual wearing a blindfold; and often there are people sitting or riding on the wheel whilst others are shown falling from it.

  

On the Waite card shown, though not necessarily on others, there are also four winged creatures in the corners of the card, representing the symbols of the [four Evangelists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Evangelists) (The Lion, the Ox, the Man and the Eagle). These four Evangelists are also represented by the four [fixed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_sign) [astrological signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_signs): [Taurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_(astrology)), [Leo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(astrology)), [Scorpio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpio_(astrology)) and [Aquarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius_(astrology)). In addition a representation of the god [Anubis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anubis) is seen rising with the wheel on the right side, while the snake-like [Typhon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhon) descends on the left. On the wheel, alternating with the letters T-A-R-O are the Hebrew letters י-ה-ו-ה, usually transliterated as [YHWH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YHWH) (Yahweh - Hebrew for God).

  

A common aspect to most interpretations of this card within a reading is to introduce an element of change in the querent's life, such change being in station, position or fortune: such as the rich becoming poor, or the poor becoming rich.

  

**strength**

Historically it was called **Fortitude**, and in the [Thoth Tarot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoth_Tarot) deck it is called [**Lust**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lust).

  

The key characters are that of a woman and a [lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion), with the woman leaning over the lion. Many cards, including that of the [Rider–Waite–Smith deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider%E2%80%93Waite%E2%80%93Smith_deck), have the woman clasping the lion's jaws. Some feature an [Infinity symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_symbol) hovering over the woman's head. Other decks have the woman sitting upon the lion, or merely with one hand upon it. Some decks feature just one of the characters; [flowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floriography) are often presented on this card.

  

According to [Eden Gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Gray), the [lemniscate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemniscate) above her represents enlightenment and spiritual powers, whereas the lion represents animal passions and earthly cravings.

  

Power, energy, action, courage, magnanimity; also complete success and honours. _Reversed:_ Despotism, abuse of power, weakness, discord, sometimes even disgrace.

  

In [Astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology), the Strength card is associated with the masculine, fixed-fire [sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_sign) of [Leo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(astrology)) and its ruling planetary body, the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_(astrology)).
