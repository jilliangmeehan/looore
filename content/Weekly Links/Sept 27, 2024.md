- [Robust Fungal Nucleus](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Robust_Fungal_Nucleus)
	- "A poet once depicted a shared dream of the Fungi in which their spores covered every inch of the mountains and oceans. The world had never been more tranquil. Then the Fungi turned into fish, birds, beasts, men, and gods, relying on rainfall, land, and their own kind who had returned to the earth."
- [Sea Ganoderma](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_Ganoderma)
	- "In the folktales told in a certain land, these mouthless, noseless creatures are the transformed souls of children who died young. As a form of punishment, they must spend endless years absorbing the elements within the sand and sea using their fragile bodies, piling them up and forming "Sea Ganoderma." And once the Ganoderma are fully formed, they shall be harvested."
